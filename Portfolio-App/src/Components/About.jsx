        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I am a Software Development student currently enrolled at Melsoft Academy. 
            I am inquisitive about the evolving digital space which is why I decided to pursue a career in tech. 
            I enjoy learning about the new technologies and how they have become useful in solving
            real world problems. 
            The desire to shift from my previous career to tech is both exciting and challenging.
            I am looking forward to gaining more knowledge as I progress and finding my niche in the field. 

            Outside of my day-to-day job and studies, I enjoy spending time with family and friends over a good meal.
